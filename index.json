In fisheries science, for example, the inference of a species' abundance distribution relies on two main data sources, namely commercial fisheries and scientific survey data. Despite efforts to combine these data into an integrated statistical model, their coupling is frequently hampered due to differences in their sampling designs, which imposes distinct bias sources in the estimator of the abundance distribution. We developed a flexible species distribution model (SDM) that can integrate both data sources while filtering out their relative bias contributions. We applied the model on three different age groups of the western Baltic cod stock. For each age group, we tested the model on (i) survey data and (ii) integrated data (survey + commercial) as a means to compare their differences and investigate how the inclusion of commercial fisheries data improved the spatiotemporal abundance estimator and parameter estimates. Moreover, we proposed a novel validation approach to evaluate whether the inclusion of commercial fisheries data in the integrated model is not in direct contradiction with the survey data. Following our approach, the results indicated that the use of commercial fisheries data is suitable for the integrated model.  Across all age groups, our results demonstrated how commercial fisheries supplied additional information on cod's spatiotemporal abundance dynamics, highlighting sometimes abundance hot-spots that were not detected by the survey model alone. Additionally, the integrated model provided a reduction of up to 20% and 10% in the uncertainty (std. error) of the predicted abundance fields and fixed-effect parameters, respectively. The proposed model represents a valuable benchmark for evaluating spatiotemporal dynamics of fish, and strengthens the science-based advice for marine policymakers.","tags":null,"title":"Bridging the gap between commercial fisheries and survey data to model the spatiotemporal dynamics of marine species","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marie-Christine Rufener","J.

This study applied a statistical species distribution model (LGNB-SDM) to design various types of fishing closures based on the concept of essential fish habitats. The potential effect of these closures were subsequently evaluated with the spatial-explicit management strategy evaluation tool DISPLACE to identify the optimal balance between socio-economic and biological impacts and sustainability demands within an ecosystem approach. The  application focused on the management of the western Baltic (WB) cod, for which we used a recent 15-year time-series (2005-2019) to unravel persistent nursery and spawning grounds. Three potential nursery and one spawning closures were identified, with most of the spawning closure overlapping one of the nursery closures. These closures were further compared against a standard seasonal spawning closure that was enforced until 2019. Overall, our simulations indicated that all fishing closures were beneficial to both supporting fisheries and the WB cod recovery. Fishing effort was nevertheless largely displaced towards other fishing grounds with redirection of catches to other fish stocks. We argue that the higher economic return was due to the increased catches of other stocks, rather than a direct consequence of the WB cod recovery in mid-term perspective. Results regarding specifically the protection of nursery and spawning grounds remained inconclusive as no substantial differences were found among them; however, both led to higher spawning stock biomass and economic return, despite at a lower level than the standard spawning closure. We conclude that the standard spawning closure was the most beneficial in terms of socio-economic and biological returns, and that it is paramount to account for the socio-economic components when evaluating the effectiveness of fisheries closures.","tags":null,"title":"A spatio-temporal framework for evaluating and minimizing economic and stock impacts of fishing closures - insights from the western Baltic cod fishery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marie-Christine Rufener","Sean Pascoe","Francois Bastardie","J.

The approach was applied on the Danish Baltic fisheries sampling program and focused on three commercially important species with different life-history traits. Irrespective of data source, species and year, our results indicated that increasing the sampling size does not result in a proportional increase in the abundance accuracy. Moreover, combining both data sources can provide abundance estimates as accurate as those informed solely by fishery-independent data. If only the abundance performance metrics should be minimized, fishery-independent data were amongst the most cost-effective. However, the most risk-averse sampling strategies occurred when fishery-dependent data were additionally considered. Similar results occurred when the abundance performance metrics were minimized together with the sampling costs.

We applied a spatial modelling platform to evaluate the effects of spatial fishery management measures on the Baltic Sea. The evaluation includes restricting areas for fishing with the dual goal of reducing the impact on benthic habitats and minimising negative effects on fishery catch and profit. To redistribute the fishing effort realistically, the model simulates individual-vessel agents and behavioural rules. The model integrates benthic community dynamics by combining gear-specific depletion rates from fishing agents with habitat-specific trait-based recovery rates for the benthic communities. Our simulations showed that closing areas in the central Baltic Sea and condensing the fishing efforts into core fishing areas did not improve the relative benthic status (RBS). In addition, the fisheries were adversely affected by reduced fishing opportunities, further impacting their economic performance. The potential for improving the overall RBS with spatial management is dubious in the central Baltic, given that the area is dominated by relatively short-lived and rapidly recovering benthic species. By contrast, the Kattegat showed a substantial improvement in the RBS, as determined by measures combining the protection of long-lived benthic communities with the mitigation of high-impact fisheries. Our results and investigations provide different bio-economic scenarios on benthos and fisheries dynamics resulting from specific management measures. The developed knowledge base and modelling tool is expected to assist policymakers in identifying the most appropriate measures to achieve both a Good Environmental Status (GES) of the seafloor according to the MSFD and to maintain sustainable fisheries and stocks according to the CFP.","tags":null,"title":"Reducing fisheries impacts on the seafloor: A bio-economic evaluation of policy strategies for improving sustainability in the Baltic Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriela A.

Although they are illegal, trawl gears are widely used by small-scale fishermen in order to catch shrimp. Shrimp trawl fisheries in tropical waters have high bycatch rates and cause a variety of problems, spanning from conflicts with other fisheries to changes in ecosystem trophic dynamics. A better understanding of the factors driving the bycatch process is therefore needed to establish reliable management measures. Here we used hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal models (HBSMs) to describe the bycatch of a small-scale shrimp trawl fishery in the Patos Lagoon estuary relative to a set of environmental and spatio-temporal predictors. Two different models were used to estimate bycatch trends':' an effort-based method (BPUE) and a ratio-based method (BR, bycatch rate). A third model was used to evaluate the dynamics of shrimp catch per unit of effort (CPUE) as this measure is equally important to describe the underlying bycatch process. Overall, the bycatch consisted of 61 species of which 45 have market value. The mean bycatch rate was 86.2% for the entire period, which represents 6 kg of bycatch for every 1 kg of shrimp caught. Although the contribution of environmental variables differed among the models, the yearly spatial effect was identified as a common that explained bycatch dynamics. Moreover, the predictive maps revealed consistent hot and cold-spots from year-to-year, which varied in intensity for BR, BPUE and CPUE, and, therefore, represent a valuable benchmark for stakeholders and managers.","tags":null,"title":"Modelling the spatio-temporal bycatch dynamics in an estuarine small-scale shrimp trawl fishery","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"The monitoring and assessment of fishery resources rely on two main datasets, namely: commercial fisheries (fishery-dependent) and scientific survey (fishery-independent) data. The monitoring includes mapping the fishery-resources to assess their spatio-temporal dynamics, procedure often conducted through statistical models that usually focus on one data type at a time. Due to their different aims, the sampling design of these data provides distinct levels of bias and consequently hampers their coupling in a joint-likelihood modelling approach. However, if these biases are properly accounted, it is hypothesized that a complete picture and more robust abundance estimates could be achieved by such a model. The main objective hereby was to develop a flexible statistical framework that can compare and integrate these datasets while accounting for their relative bias contributions. As such, a Negative Binomial Cox Process model (NBCP) was designed in Template Model Builder (TMB), where several abundance-related response-variables can be specified and differences in fishing catchability and effort, trawled distance and spatio-temporal correlations can be accounted. Special attention was given to correct the preferential-sampling nature of the fishery-dependent data. To demonstrate its broad applicability, the model was applied on data-rich and -poor stocks from the Kattegat-Western Baltic Sea. For each case study, the NBCP model was tested on (i) commercial, (ii) survey, and (iii) coupled data to assess their differences and evaluate the improvements in abundance estimates. The results revealed that each data source supplied different, yet complementary, information on the species dynamics. Moreover, they confirmed that more precise abundance estimates were obtained by the integrated set-up, especially for the data-poor stocks and where the preferential-sampling bias was considered. Although the fishermen\u0026rsquo;s prevailed sampling behaviour can still be improved, the proposed NBCP model will likely support future stock management and is particularly a benchmark for data-poor stocks due to the boosting of information.\n Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Such tools are needed to evaluate scenarios of different management strategies in order to inform managers and stakeholders about the impacts and relative performance of different management options in achieving the policy objectives. This demands implementation of MSE tools which encompass the dynamic variability in distribution and abundance of fish resources with high resolution in time and space. Also, this demands integration of bio-economic MSE tools which can evaluate fishing patterns and fisher's decision making, i.e. human behaviour, in allocating their fishing effort with high resolution in time and space. Consequently, these tools must be highly spatial explicit and enable small scale time specific resolution in order to efficiently and realistically evaluating the integrated biological and economic effects of spatial management, and contribute to improving spatial management strategies also taking into account the footpring of the marine capture sector including energy use and efficiency to catch the available fishery resources.

Techniques of spatial statistics were used to identify biomass trends and species richness. The main objectives were to generate new information about the specific composition of the fish fauna, allowing the identification of the spatial and temporal distribution of fishing resources, as well as the influence of environmental variables on habitat use, generating information that contributes to establishing measures of management and conservation of the fishing resources of the region. Bottom trawls were conducted on the northern coast of the continental shelf of Rio Grande do Norte (Northeast of Brazil), between May 2002 and November 2004. A total of 20,895 fishes (806.5 kg) distributed within 153 species, 108 genera and 57 families were caught. The number of species identified by trawls ranged from 1 to 46. For species richness, the season of the year, depth, latitude, longitude and distance from the coast were statistically significant. Fish biomass presented values between 0.76 and 6,132 g/km, with highest values occurring between depths of 45 and 65 m during the rainy season, while in dry period higher biomass was found in depths from 35 to 75 m. According to the GLM, season of the year and depth influence the distribution of biomass. Thus, in general terms both models indicated that environmental variables directly influence the occurrence and distribution of the ichthyofauna of the continental shelf of Rio Grande do Norte and therefore should be prioritized in establishing measures for conservation and management of these important resources.","tags":null,"title":"Demersal fishes of the northeast Brazilian continental shelf: Spatial patterns and their temporal variation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

This covers methods, simulation models and management strategy evaluation (MSE) tools to conduct assessment and evaluate economic efficiency and risks in exploiting data poor stocks caught in mixed, small scale, and indigenous fisheries. Particular focus is on accessibility of models and their development to ensure widespread and open access availability, user-friendly model operation, and efficient widespread adoption and implementation of those by scientists, stakeholders, and managers. Additional focus is on the data requirements for those models. Finally, the aim of the session was to discuss the best possible way to link economic assessments, risk assessment and MSE with biological (ecological) assessment of stock status according to sustainable harvest levels in those data limited situations and systems to provide robust assessment and advice - and maybe even integrated ecological-economic advice?","tags":null,"title":"Challenges in Implementing Stock Assessment, Economic Fishery Analysis, and Risk Assessment for Sustainable Management Strategies of Data Poor Stocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vinicius M.

This analysis enabled the identification of differential distribution patterns. Pink shrimp abundance was studied to understand what factors influence the occupation of the estuary. Monthly samples were taken with a trawl net at 12 sites in the estuary from September 2010 to January 2013. Comparisons were made between protected and unprotected sites. Both PL and JU had a wide distribution in the estuary. The temperature was not a significant variable for explaining abundance variability. The abundance of PL increased with salinity and influenced PL entry to the estuary. The highest abundances of PL were found in unprotected areas and protected sites at the mouth of the estuary, while juveniles were unevenly distributed with higher abundance in protected areas. Recruitment period of PL in the estuary was October to March, and of juveniles was November to February. We suggest that the preservation of unprotected shallow waters and protected areas at the mouth of the estuary are key to further recruitment of the species in the estuary.","tags":null,"title":"Distribution and abundance of post-larvae and juvenile pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus paulensis (Perez Farfante, 1967) in a subtropical estuary","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Quantitative fish stock assessment methods have become increasingly complex. However, the quality of available data may still restrict their applicability, being a particular concern in data-poor situations and where management decisions rely on either commercial fisheries or scientific survey data. In this study we address this issue by proposing a flexible statistical tool that can compare and integrate both datasets simultaneously, and hence boost the amount of information. Because of different sampling designs and procedures, distinct levels of biases arise between datatypes (e.g., different spatio-temporal coverages and size spectra of fish), which are accounted for in our model framework. The model is developed in Template Model Builder, alternatively applied to (i) commercial data, (ii) survey data and (iii) coupled datasets, and tested on cod, plaice and sprat stocks in the western Baltic Sea (2005-2016). We find that each data type supply different, yet complementary, information on the species spatio-temporal dynamics. Though the overall spatial pattern in both datatypes shows similar trends, the variability was clearly higher when evaluating the datasets separately, while the coupled dataset were most informative. This confirms that the predictive modelling was greatly improved by joining the datasets and will likely enhance future stock evaluation and management advice in both data-poor and data-rich contexts. Moreover, the current tool represent a valuable benchmark for fishery-based bio-economic management evaluation tools, provided that ecological-economic systems can be reliably mocked at a spatio-temporal scale that our model support and which indeed matters for robust management and policy makers.\n Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

However, vulnerable habitats rarely become MPAs due to conflicting interests such as fishing. We propose a spatial framework to help researchers and managers determine optimal conservation areas in a multi-species fishery, while also considering the economic relevance these species may have in a given society, even in data poor situations. We first set different ecological criteria (i.e. species resilience, vulnerability and trophic level) to identify optimal areas for conservation and restoration efforts, which was based on a traditional conservationist approach. We then identified the most economically relevant sites, where the bulk of fishery profits come from. We overlapped the ecologically and economically relevant areas using different thresholds. By ranking the level of overlap between the sites, representing different levels of conflicts between traditional conservation and fishing interests, we suggest alternatives that could increase fishers' acceptance of protected areas. The introduction of some flexibility in the way conservation targets are established could contribute to reaching a middle ground where biological concerns are integrated with economic demands from the fishing sector.","tags":null,"title":"Searching for a compromise between biological and economic demands to protect vulnerable habitats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marie-Christine Rufener","Paul G.

In the present study we proposed hierarchical Bayesian spatial models to quantify and map sensitive habitats for juveniles, adults and overall abundance of the vulnerable lane snapper (Lutjanus synagris) present in the northeastern Brazil. Data were collected by fishery-unbiased gillnet surveys, and fitted through the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) tools, both implemented in the R environment by the R-INLA library (http://www.r-inla.org). Our results confirmed that the abundance of juveniles and adults of L. synagris are spatially correlated, have patchy distributions along the Rio Grande do Norte coast, and are mainly affected by environmental predictors such as distance to coast, chlorophyll-a concentration, bathymetry and sea surface temperature. By means of our results we intended to consolidate a recently introduced Bayesian geostatistical model into fisheries science, highlighting its potential for establishing more reliable measures for the conservation and management of vulnerable fish species even when data are sparse.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian spatial predictive models for data-poor fisheries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://mcruf.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
